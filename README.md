* Not all homework assignments are solved correctly, so the code is just for the purpose of sharing. 
* To run the `.sp` files, you need HSpice installed in your Linux, then run 'hspice file.sp' in terminal. To plot the results, you need CosmosScope installed in your Linux.
* You also need `cic018.l` virtual techfile to run the `.sp` files, but it's unappropriate to upload it here :no_mouth:, you may find many on the Internet :)
